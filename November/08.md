# Deleting Issues
### Adding a delete button
In this section we're going to implement the feature to delete an issue. In the `[id]` folder, let's add a new file called, 
`DeleteIssueButton.tsx`, create an interface props for `issueId` and type is `number`. Return a `button` from `Radix UI`.
```<Button color="red">Delete Issue</Button>;``` , Now go to the `page.tsx` in the `id` folder and add the component we just created below
the edit issue button. `<DeleteIssueButton issueId={issue.id} />`. Now let's add a `Flex` element around the buttons to have a better styling
and so that they're aligned 
```
<Flex direction="column" gap="4">
          <EditIssueButton issueId={issue.id} />
          <DeleteIssueButton issueId={issue.id} />
        </Flex>
```
Also add a `className` around the first `Box` element
```
 <Box className='md:col-span-4'>
        <IssueDetails issue={issue} />
      </Box>
```
