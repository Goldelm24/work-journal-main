### Uploading files
First let's chose a cloud platform called `Cloudinary`. Cloudinary has perfect integration with Nextjs, it is simple to set up with low amount of coding.

Head over to `Cloudinary.com` to create an account. <br/>
In the terminal run `npm i next-cloudinary`, in the google browser look up for `next cloudinary` and copy the 2nd step given. Go back to Vscode, open `.env` file and paste..
```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:Warriors30@localhost:3306/nextapp"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="dqpchi9np"
```
The cloud name can be found on `Cloudinary.com`, you can copy and paste it.

We then create an `upload` folder and a `page.tsx` file.
```
'use client';
import React from 'react';
import { CldUploadWidget } from 'next-cloudinary';

const UploadPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <CldUploadWidget uploadPreset='ew5fapne'>
        {({ open }) => 
        <button 
        className='btn btn-primary' onClick={() => open()}>Upload</button>}
      </CldUploadWidget>
    </div>
  )
}

export default UploadPage
```
The `uploadPreset` can be found in `cloudinary`, on the settings/upload click where it says `asigned` and change it to `unsigned`, copy the preset to paste it in the widget.
To understand more about how this works we would have to read the documentation, it'll be something that I will be doing later on.

### Showing Uploaded Images
```
<CldUploadWidget 
        uploadPreset='ew5fapne'
        onUpload={(result, widget) => {
            console.log(result);
        }}>
```
When uploading an image, the `onUpload` allows us to see the full image before sending it to the cloud.
Final code ...
```
interface CloudinaryResult {
    public_id: string
}

const UploadPage = () => {
const [publicId, setPublicId] = useState('')

  return (
    <>
        {publicId && 
        <CldImage src={publicId} width={270} height={180} alt='Headphones image'/>}
      <CldUploadWidget 
        uploadPreset='ew5fapne'
        onUpload={(result, widget) => {
            if (result.event !== 'success') return;
            const info = result.info as CloudinaryResult
            setPublicId(info.public_id)
        }}>
        {({ open }) => 
        <button 
        className='btn btn-primary' onClick={() => open()}>Upload</button>}
      </CldUploadWidget>
    </>
```
The final step is customizing the upload widget.
Head over to `https://demo.cloudinary.com/uw/#/` from there we can select what sources we want to allow. 
```
 options={{
            sources: ['local'],
            multiple: false,
            maxFiles: 5,
            styles: {}
        }}
```
