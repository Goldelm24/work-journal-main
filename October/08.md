### Authentication with Next Auth
Authentication verifies who a user is, while authorization controls what a user can access. `NextAuth.js` is a popular authentication library for Next.js application.
We can head over `next-auth.js.org`. We then run `npm i next-auth` in the terminal.
### Add API route
To add NextAuth.js to a project create a file called `[...nextauth].js` in `pages/api/auth`. This contains the dynamic route handler for `NextAuth.js` which will also contain all of your global `NextAuth.js` configurations.
```
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import GithubProvider from "next-auth/providers/github"

export const authOptions = {
  // Configure one or more authentication providers
  providers: [
    GithubProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET,
    }),
    // ...add more providers here
  ],
}

export default NextAuth(authOptions)
```
That is an example of how it would look when hard coding this
