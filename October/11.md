### Sending Emails

Setting up React Email, let's head over to `react.email` on the broswer, there you can more details about how it works. To set up our environment we can go back to our code and in the terminal run `npm i react-email @react-email/components`.
After the packages are installed we go to `package.json` and add ` "preview-email": "email dev -p 3030"` to our scripts to have another development like `port:3000`. Now outside the root folder we create a new folder called `emails`.

### Creating an Email Template
Inside the `emails` folder let's add a file called `WelcomeTemplate.tsx`. Below is an example of how we can craft an email template.
```
import React from 'react';
import { Html, Body, Container, Text, Link, Preview } from '@react-email/components'

const WelcomeTemplate = ({ name }: { name: string }) => {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Preview>Welcome aboard!</Preview>
      <Body>
        <Container>
            <Text>Hllo {name} </Text>
            <Link href='https://josias&anyeline.com'>www.josias&anyeline.com</Link>
        </Container>
      </Body>
    </Html>
  )
}

export default WelcomeTemplate
```

### Previewing Emails
First let's open `.gitignore` and add `.react-email/` to let `git` know that we don't want to track any files in this folder.
Let's go to the terminal and run `npm run preview-email` to run the port we created at the beginning. On the browser it opens up a `localhost:3030`.

### Styling Emails
The are two ways of styling, it can be with `CSS` or `Tailwind`. Back to the `WelcomeTemplate` component, now lets add some styling. Lets create some `CSS` properties
```
const body: CSSProperties = {
    background: '#fff'
}

const heading: CSSProperties = {
    fontSize: '32px'
}
```
Now we can pass them to the `<Body>` and `<Text>` tags like this, <Body style={body}>, <Text style={heading}>Hello {name} </Text>
