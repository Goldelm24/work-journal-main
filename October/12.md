### Optimizing Images
In the public folder lets create an image folder. Then we drag any picture we want and then import the image to the `page.tsx` which is the home page. `import man from '@/public/images/man.png'` you can name the image whatever you like.
Then we pass it as an `<Image>` component.
```
return (
    <main>
      <Image src={man} alt='Man'/>
    </main>
  );
```
This a way to show local images.
Now to render URL's we need to read the documentation about the `Next.js` image component and search for `remotePatterns`. We will have to copy and paste the configuration code like it shows below
```
images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'example.com',
        port: '',
        pathname: '/account123/**',
      },
    ],
  },
```
The code goes in the `next.config.js` and at the end it all looks like this.
```
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    images: {
        remotePatterns: [
          {
            protocol: 'https',
            hostname: 'example.com',
            port: '',
            pathname: '/account123/**',
          },
        ],
      },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```
Now that we have this we can delete `port` and `pahtname` as it's not neccesary. In the home page we pass 
```
<Image
        src="https://bit.ly/react-cover"
        alt="man"
        fill
        style={{ objectFit: 'cover'}}
      />
```
Note that for this to render the image you need to give it a `width` and a `height` but since we used the fill it'll automatically do that for us, the style helps to spread the image that it stays with its orignal aspect ratio.
