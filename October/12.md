### Optimizing Images
In the public folder lets create an image folder. Then we drag any picture we want and then import the image to the `page.tsx` which is the home page. `import man from '@/public/images/man.png'` you can name the image whatever you like.
Then we pass it as an `<Image>` component.
```
return (
    <main>
      <Image src={man} alt='Man'/>
    </main>
  );
```
This a way to show local images.
Now to render URL's we need to read the documentation about the `Next.js` image component and search for `remotePatterns`. We will have to copy and paste the configuration code like it shows below
```
images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'example.com',
        port: '',
        pathname: '/account123/**',
      },
    ],
  },
```
The code goes in the `next.config.js` and at the end it all looks like this.
```
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    images: {
        remotePatterns: [
          {
            protocol: 'https',
            hostname: 'example.com',
            port: '',
            pathname: '/account123/**',
          },
        ],
      },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```
Now that we have this we can delete `port` and `pahtname` as it's not neccesary. In the home page we pass 
```
<Image
        src="https://bit.ly/react-cover"
        alt="man"
        fill
        style={{ objectFit: 'cover'}}
      />
```
Note that for this to render the image you need to give it a `width` and a `height` but since we used the fill it'll automatically do that for us, the `style` `cover` helps to spread the image that it stays with its orignal aspect ratio. You can also use `contain` and that would make it fit within the container.
Antother way is to style with `Tailwind` like this `className='object-cover'`, we get the same resul as before. It's also good to keep in mind that adding `sizes` allows the image to fit all devices, we do that by setting the size to `sizes='100vw'`, takes 100% of the view.
To see this on different devices using something similar to `queries` we use it this `sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 50vw, 33vw"`. Final code 
```
return (
    <main className='relative h-screen'>
      <Image
        src="https://bit.ly/react-cover"
        alt="man"
        fill
        className="object-cover"
        sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 50vw, 33vw"
        quality={100}
        priority
      />
    </main>
  );
```
### Using third-party scripts
We create a component and code this 
```
import Script from 'next/script';
import React from 'react';

const GoogleAnalyticsScript = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Script
        async
        src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-E720JHXSJ2"
      />
      <Script id="google-analytics">
        {`window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
      gtag('js', new Date());

      gtag('config', 'G-E720JHXSJ1');`}
      </Script>
    </>
  );
};

export default GoogleAnalyticsScript;
```
Then we pass it to our `layout.tsx` component `<GoogleAnalyticsScript />`
```
<html lang="en" data-theme="winter">
      <GoogleAnalyticsScript />
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <AuthProvider>
          <NavBar />
          <main className="p-5">{children}</main>
        </AuthProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
```
### Using Fonts
In the beginning we were using the `Inter` font for our application. Nextjs has hundreds of fonts and if we want to use a different we just import. `import { Inter, Roboto } from 'next/font/google';` here I included `Roboto`, then I created an object 
``const roboto = Roboto({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  weight: ['400', '500']
})``
and ... `<body className={roboto.className}>` instead of `Inter` we use `Roboto` is that simple
