### Optimizing Images
In the public folder lets create an image folder. Then we drag any picture we want and then import the image to the `page.tsx` which is the home page. `import man from '@/public/images/man.png'` you can name the image whatever you like.
Then we pass it as an `<Image>` component.
```
return (
    <main>
      <Image src={man} alt='Man'/>
    </main>
  );
```
This a way to show local images.
Now to render URL's we need to read the documentation about the `Next.js` image component and search for `remotePatterns`. We will have to copy and paste the configuration code like it shows below
```
images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'example.com',
        port: '',
        pathname: '/account123/**',
      },
    ],
  },
```
The code goes in the `next.config.js` and at the end it all looks like this.
```
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    images: {
        remotePatterns: [
          {
            protocol: 'https',
            hostname: 'example.com',
            port: '',
            pathname: '/account123/**',
          },
        ],
      },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```
Now that we have this we can delete `port` and `pahtname` as it's not neccesary. In the home page we pass 
```
<Image
        src="https://bit.ly/react-cover"
        alt="man"
        fill
        style={{ objectFit: 'cover'}}
      />
```
Note that for this to render the image you need to give it a `width` and a `height` but since we used the fill it'll automatically do that for us, the `style` `cover` helps to spread the image that it stays with its orignal aspect ratio. You can also use `contain` and that would make it fit within the container.
Antother way is to style with `Tailwind` like this `className='object-cover'`, we get the same resul as before. It's also good to keep in mind that adding `sizes` allows the image to fit all devices, we do that by setting the size to `sizes='100vw'`, takes 100% of the view.
To see this on different devices using something similar to `queries` we use it this `sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 50vw, 33vw"`. Final code 
```
return (
    <main className='relative h-screen'>
      <Image
        src="https://bit.ly/react-cover"
        alt="man"
        fill
        className="object-cover"
        sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 50vw, 33vw"
        quality={100}
        priority
      />
    </main>
  );
```
### Using third-party scripts
We create a component and code this 
```
import Script from 'next/script';
import React from 'react';

const GoogleAnalyticsScript = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Script
        async
        src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-E720JHXSJ2"
      />
      <Script id="google-analytics">
        {`window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
      gtag('js', new Date());

      gtag('config', 'G-E720JHXSJ1');`}
      </Script>
    </>
  );
};

export default GoogleAnalyticsScript;
```
Then we pass it to our `layout.tsx` component `<GoogleAnalyticsScript />`
```
<html lang="en" data-theme="winter">
      <GoogleAnalyticsScript />
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <AuthProvider>
          <NavBar />
          <main className="p-5">{children}</main>
        </AuthProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
```
### Using Fonts
In the beginning we were using the `Inter` font for our application. Nextjs has hundreds of fonts and if we want to use a different we just import. `import { Inter, Roboto } from 'next/font/google';` here I included `Roboto`, then I created an object 
``const roboto = Roboto({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  weight: ['400', '500']
})``
and ... `<body className={roboto.className}>` instead of `Inter` we use `Roboto` is that simple. We can also apply custom fonts. Creating a folder inside `public` called `fonts` then we paste the `poppins` font we downloaded. Lets import `import localFont from 'next/font/local';`

```
const poppins = localFont({
  src: '../public/fonts/poppins-regular-webfont.woff2',
})
```
Now we can pass it `<body className={poppins.className}>`. Now lets see how we can apply styling with `Tailwind`.
we add ` variable: '--font-poppins'` to the `poppins` object and set it to a custom `css` property `'--font-poppins'`, lets change the `className` to `variable` , `<body className={poppins.variable}>`. We should head over to `tailwind.config.ts` file and add the `font-family` to `poppins`. `theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily:{
        poppins: 'var(--fonts-poppins)'
      },`
In the home page we can add a `className` to our `<H1>`. `<h1 className='font-poppins'>Hello Brothers</h1>`
We can also apply the custom css to the `global.css` file to avoid repetition and add this `@layer base {
  h1 {
    @apply font-extrabold text-2xl mb-3 font-poppins;
  }
}`
This way we don't have to add a `className` to change the font.

### Lazy loading
We can create a file inside the component folder to test this. We can call it `HeavyComponent`, the name is simply give an example of a component that has a lot of code. If we didn't want to load our heavy component from the jump, we can add a `button` that can be set to `false` so that only when clicked it would execute and gives all that information we want. This a way to prevent heavy load of data that can affect our refreshing time. 
```
'use client';
import { useState } from 'react';
import HeavyComponent from './components/HeavyComponent';

export default function Home() {
const [isVisible, setVisible] = useState(false);

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Hello Brothers</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setVisible(true)}>Show</button>
      {isVisible && <HeavyComponent />}
    </main>
  );
}
```
Lets import `dynamic` function from 'next/dynamic'  `import dynamic from "next/dynamic";`, now instead of importing the `HeavyComponent` statically, we use the dynamic function to import it dynamically.
`const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./components/HeavyComponent'));`, this how we lazy load component using the dynamic function. Note that is only ideal to use `lazy loading` on large components because importing statically is more lightweight if it's a small component. 
`const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./components/HeavyComponent'), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
});`, this is how we can lazy load `client component`.<br/>

We can also `lazy load` External JS Libraries, as an example lets install `lodash` and `-D @types/lodash`
This is how `lodash` would be render dynamically 
```
<main>
      <h1>Hello Brothers</h1>
      <button onClick={async () => {
        const _ = (await import('lodash')).default

        const users = [
          {name: 'c'},
          {name: 'b'},
          {name: 'a'}
        ];

       const sorted = _.orderBy(users, ['name']);
        console.log(sorted)
      }}>Show</button>
      
    </main>
```
