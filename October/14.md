# We will build a full-stack with Nextjs
## Technologies: Nexth.js, Typescript, Tailwind, Radix UI, Prisma, MySQL, NextAuth.js
#### Getting Started
Setting up our project
Open the terminal: cd Desktop
run `npx create-next-app@13.4.19` or `@latest`, give the project a name like `Issue tracker` and then select all the default settings.
`typescript, tailwind, eslint...`, now we can `cd` to the folder and run `npm run dev`.
You can open the project in `vs code` and lets do some clean up. We can delete all markup from the home page `page.tsx` and add a simple <div>. In the `global.css` file lets delete these two ` --background-start-rgb: 0, 0, 0;,
    --background-end-rgb: 0, 0, 0;` and the background color from the `body` element.
```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

:root {
  --foreground-rgb: 0, 0, 0;
  --background-start-rgb: 214, 219, 220;
  --background-end-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --foreground-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
    --background-start-rgb: 0, 0, 0;
    --background-end-rgb: 0, 0, 0;
  }
}

body {
  color: rgb(var(--foreground-rgb));
}
```
This is how the `global.css` should look now. To get used to making commit, we can make one now. Open the source control and add the changes. This is something important to do because we can keep track of what we fixing or changing in the project by giving it names. This is good practice for when you're working as a team. We can call this commit `Initial set up`.
