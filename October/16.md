# Creating Issues
To start we need to first install `MySQL` and `DataGrip`. Now we need `prisma`, head over to the terminal and run `npm i prisma@5.3.1`, next run `npx prisma init` to initialize prisma in this project. 
Now we get a folder calles `prisma` and a file called `chema.prisma`, inside this file we see this code 
```
 generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```
By default the provider runs on `"postgresql"`, you just have to change it to `mysql` like it shows above. We can now open `.env` file and change the `DATABASE_URL` to `mysql` as well as few other changes.
This is how should look `DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:MyPassword@localhost:3306/issue-tracker"`. Lets make a commit to save this changes. I'll call it `setting up Prisma`.
