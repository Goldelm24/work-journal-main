### Additional Loading skeletons
Now lets add a proper skeleton that has the same look and feel of this page. Now back in the `[id]` folder lets grab some code
from the `page.tsx` file and paste in our `loading.tsx` file. Now lets get these two imports, `import Skeleteon from 'react-loading-skeleton`
& `import 'react-loading-skeleton/dist/skeleton.css'`. Now lets make some changes.
```
<Box className='max-w-xl'>
      <Skeleteon/>
      <Flex className="space-x-3" my="2">
        <Skeleteon width='5rem'/>
        <Skeleteon width='8rem'/>
      </Flex>
      <Card className="prose" mt="4">
       <Skeleteon count={3}/>
      </Card>
    </Box>
```
Here we used a `Box` element as well as `skeletons` with different sizes, count and tailwind class for the Box element. Now we need a separate skeleton for the new issue page. Let's go to the `new` folder, open the `loading.tsx` file. 
```
const LoadingNewIssuePage = () => {
  return (
    <Box className='max-w-xl'>
     <Skeleton/>
     <Skeleton height='20rem'/>
    </Box>
  )
}
```
Remember to import these two imports when using skeletons, `import Skeleteon from 'react-loading-skeleton`
& `import 'react-loading-skeleton/dist/skeleton.css'`. 

### Disabling Serser-side-rendering
To do this lets replace the `SimpleMED` with `dynamic`, then we dynamically load this component, this call `lazy loading`, we declarea 
constant, we can call it the same as our component `SimpleMDE`
```
const SimpleMDE = dynamic(
  () => import('react-simplemde-editor'), 
  { ssr: false}
)
```
We set the `ssr` to false to tell Nextjs not to render this component on the server.
