### Adding the eidt button
In the `[id]` folder let's go to `page.tsx` and replace `<div>` with the `Grid` component in `Radix UI`. Next set the columns props to `"2"`,
Now lets wrap everything inside the `Grid` component with a  `Box` from `Radix UI`. Now after the `Box` closing tag, let's add another `Box`
to have a second column and this would have a `Button`. Now when viewing this on different devices it seems to be stretch out so to fix that,
we can change the columns prop, instead of passing a string , we can pass an object with the initial value for small devices and a second
for medium devices like this ```columns={{ initial: '1', md: '2' }}```, 1 is for mobile and second is for laptops. The last thing is adding an
icon. We first need to install a package called, ```npm i @radix-ui/react-icons```. Now import the icon we want to use, in this case we are 
going with the pencil icon. `import { Pencil2Icon } from '@radix-ui/react-icons'`. We then add the icon inside the `Button` tag and right
after a `Link` component define in `next/link`. The final code would look like this
```
 <Grid columns={{ initial: '1', md: '2' }} gap="5">
      <Box>
        <Heading>{issue.title}</Heading>
        <Flex className="space-x-3" my="2">
          <IssueStatusBadge status={issue.status} />
          <Text>{issue.createdAt.toDateString()}</Text>
        </Flex>
        <Card className="prose" mt="4">
          <ReactMarkdown>{issue.description}</ReactMarkdown>
        </Card>
      </Box>
      <Box>
        <Button>
          <Pencil2Icon />
          <Link href={`/issues/${issue.id}/edit`}>Edit Issue</Link>
        </Button>
      </Box>
    </Grid>
```
### Single responsibility Principle
In the `[id]` folder let's add a file called `EditIssueButton.tsx`, there we will more our `Button` so we can have a cleaner and a better
responsive page.

```
interface Props {
    issueId: number
}

const EditIssueButton = ({ issueId }: Props) => {
  return (
    <Button>
      <Pencil2Icon />
      <Link href={`/issues/${issueId}/edit`}>Edit Issue</Link>
    </Button>
  );
};

export default EditIssueButton;
```
Then we pass the the component we created inside the `Button` tag like this ```<EditIssueButton issueId={issue.id}/>```. Here we get the 
same results but we are able to manage this individually as a single page. Now let's do the same refactoringto the details on the 
left column. We create a file called `IssueDetails.tsx` and then move everything insid the first `Box` to the this component. We also
have to create an interface to pass our props. The code in this component should look like this 
```
import { IssueStatusBadge } from '@/app/components';
import { Issue } from '@prisma/client';
import { Card, Flex, Heading, Text } from '@radix-ui/themes';
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown';

interface Props {
  issue: Issue;
}

const IssueDetails = ({ issue }: Props) => {
  return (
    <>
      <Heading>{issue.title}</Heading>
      <Flex className="space-x-3" my="2">
        <IssueStatusBadge status={issue.status} />
        <Text>{issue.createdAt.toDateString()}</Text>
      </Flex>
      <Card className="prose" mt="4">
        <ReactMarkdown>{issue.description}</ReactMarkdown>
      </Card>
    </>
  );
};

export default IssueDetails;
```
Now let's add it to `page.tsx` inside the `Box` component. The final code for the `page.tsx` is 
```
import prisma from '@/prisma/client';
import { Box, Grid } from '@radix-ui/themes';
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';
import EditIssueButton from './EditIssueButton';
import IssueDetails from './IssueDetails';

interface Props {
  params: { id: string };
}

const IssueDetailPage = async ({ params }: Props) => {
  const issue = await prisma.issue.findUnique({
    where: { id: parseInt(params.id) },
  });

  if (!issue) notFound();

  return (
    <Grid columns={{ initial: '1', md: '2' }} gap="5">
      <Box>
        <IssueDetails issue={issue}/>
      </Box>
      <Box>
        <EditIssueButton issueId={issue.id}/>
      </Box>
    </Grid>
  );
};

export default IssueDetailPage;
```
The code is concise, cleaner and more manegable, if we decide to make some changes to the layout with only need to go to the `Page` file,
if we need to make changes to the `Button` we can do that in the `EditIssueButton`, sames as the `IssueDetails`, we can keep things separate
and the code more organize. This allows the project to have a single page responsibility.
