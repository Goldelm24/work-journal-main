### Building the edit issue page
In the `[id]` folder, let's add a new folder called `edit`, next we add the `page.tsx` file. Go to the NewIssuePage, copy the code and move it
to a reusable component. In the `issues` folder, let's add new folder called `components`, here we are going to add components that are
reusable in the issues section. There add a new file called `IssueForm.tsx` and paste the code we copied and make few changes, the constant
name to `IssueForm` and the `type` to `IssueFormData`. Now back to the `NewIssuePage`, delete all the code and create a new react component
and call it the same name it had before `NewIssuePage`, then return the `<IssueForm/>`. Now let's focus on building the edit page. There let's
also use the `<IssueForm/>`. We are also going to add an interface for capturing route parameters 
```
interface Props {
    params: { id: string}
}
```
Now we have to use `Prisma` to fetch the issue with the given `id`.
```
const EditIssuePage = async ({ params }: Props) => {
  const issue = await prisma.issue.findUnique({
    where: { id: parseInt(params.id) },
  });
```
If the `issue` doesn't exist we should redirect the user to the `notFound` page. In the issue form let's add an interface
```
interface Props {
  issue?: Issue
}
```
Then we pass this prop as `defaultValue` as the `title` and `description` like this
``` <TextField.Input defaultValue={issue?.title} placeholder="Title" {...register('title')} />``` and the description,
```
   <Controller
          name="description"
          control={control}
          defaultValue={issue?.description}
          render={({ field }) => (
            <SimpleMDE placeholder="Description" {...field} />
          )}
        />
```
The final code for the edit page is 
```
import React from 'react';
import IssueForm from '../../_components/IssueForm';
import prisma from '@/prisma/client';
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

interface Props {
  params: { id: string };
}

const EditIssuePage = async ({ params }: Props) => {
  const issue = await prisma.issue.findUnique({
    where: { id: parseInt(params.id) },
  });

  if (!issue) notFound();

  return (
    <div>
      <IssueForm issue={issue}/>
    </div>
  );
};

export default EditIssuePage;
```
